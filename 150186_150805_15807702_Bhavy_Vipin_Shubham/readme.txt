The notebook and python  files for the questions are as follow:
Question 1 : Q1-gabor-filter.ipynb | Q1-gabor-filter.py, 
Question 2 : Q2-feature-simulation.ipynb | Q2-feature-simulation.py
Question 3 : Q3-response-time.ipynb | Q3-response-time.py
-------------------------------------------------
Packages Used:
Opencv: 3.4
numpy
matplotlib
----------------------------------------------------
Steps to run the files:

Question 1 : 

To generate gabor response from Q1-gabor-filter.py, change the global variable name FILENAME1 to the image.jpg and run the file. Correspondingly gaborimage.jpg will be genrated and its label output  will be displayed on the terminal.   

Question 2:

To simulate from Q2-feature-simulation.py, just change the variable TRIANGLES and SQUARES accordingly and both the feature search and conjunction search paradigm will be generated.

Question 3:

In this part we generated feature and conjunction images for different no of objects. Response time graph is generated.
